# AudioLAB
* New and Improved

# Generic LV2 Plugins
* They will accumulate in some times
* They do not have a GUI the host will make it
* They are generic and are just things that are useful or for experiments

# I did not want to use LV2 for a long time
* Bad documents and no explanation of anything anywhere
* Want to make your own host you will punch it in the face
* Want to send midi to a LV2 plugin you will punch it in the face

# It should not be very hard to load a plugin and use it
* It is what make Ladspa good for experimenter
* The LV2 does not explain anything of how you use it
* Only some useless things about the API that are useless unless you can find example of how it works
* the meaning of the thing is meaningless without the context of what it works where
* Well, it is not really a very difficult thing at all
* But the documents are shit
