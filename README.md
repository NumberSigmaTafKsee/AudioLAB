# AmpClipperCircuit
* It is something I found which doesn't have alot of practical purpose at this time for anything
* It is supposed to be a diode clipper but it is like a diode filter instead
* It has significance as it demonstrate the theory of a non-linear memory algorithm despite it wasn't supposed to
