# AudioLAB
* New and Improved

# It contains all the reference c++ codes
* All the C++ is maintanenaced in here

# It is meant to be used in script languages
* Thus, it is an insanely impossible thing to maintain and keep sane about it

# All the other projects will use it
* To make simple, put in a directory in the same location of the project
* It just simply include ../AudioLAB-Cpp/include
 
# I do not make anything in here
* Everything is linked to the headers and such in one place
* If there is bug in the C++ it is fixed here
* It is all header only
* It is only meant for making experiments in a single c++ file

# You have to rename it to AudioLAB-C++
* You can not make it C++ in Github
* I do not want it to be Cpp
