# It's about algorithms
* They are all reference in c++
* They must work correctly
* People make the algorithms
* I make alot of algorithms too

# Everything gets tests

# I am optimizing now the shebang
* It is using openmp SIMD
* Polyphonic will use openmp parallel
* The GPU processors are in cuda and opencl
* I am not using OpenACC because i can't it to work in gcc

# Languages
