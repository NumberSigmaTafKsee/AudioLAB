# AmpClipper
* I had found this in the bargain bin
* Now, it has alot of problems and doesn't work right
* First, it has a capacitor so it was a filter
* Thus, I do not know what circuit he made this for
* However, it has potential to use it for the experiments

# The AmpClipperCircuit only have some significance to Druidery
* The normal society will not care much about the observation of non-linear memory

# I still think it is very cool
* We dont know what he observed to make an amplifier clipper circuit
* But what he made was a didoe filter
