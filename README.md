# AudioLAB
* New and Improved

# Generic LV2 Plugins
* They will accumulate in some times
* They do not have a GUI the host will make it
* They are generic and are just things that are useful or for experiments

# I did not want to use LV2 for a long time
* Bad documents and no explanation of anything anywhere
* Want to make your own host you will punch it in the face
* Want to send midi to a LV2 plugin you will punch it in the face
