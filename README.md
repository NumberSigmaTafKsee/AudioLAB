# AudioLAB
 Generic LV2 Plugins

# I have the theory
* I have the power to make it take my course

# Current Plugin
* AnalogSVF
* MoogLadderFilters
* AmpClipper

# AnalogSVF
* Just your kind of svf
* From the Will Pirkin Theory Society
* Has a built in ADSR envelope that can be midi trigger
* Has a built in LFO
* It will work in frequency or it can be set to control-voltage
* It will have a built in LuaJIT interpreter for control-midi-matrix theory and tap alchemy
* It should be possible to modulate it per sample by the FIAXY equations

# MoogLadderFilters
* All of them are from github
* Has built in ADSR and LFO
* It will have a built in LuaJIT interpreter for control-midi-matrix theory and tap alchemy
* It will work in frequency or it can be set to control-voltage

# AmpClipperCircuit
* It is something I found which doesn't have alot of practical purpose at this time for anything
* It is supposed to be a diode clipper but it is like a diode filter instead
* It has significance as it demonstrate the theory of a non-linear memory algorithm despite it wasn't supposed to

# LiquidSVF
* It is the AnalogSVF but it uses liquid neurons for the coefficients

# AdalineSVF
* It uses adaptive adaline neuron coefficients

# FIRSvf
* It uses frequency sampling of the state variable filter

# FIRMoog
* It uses frequency sampling of the moog filters

# IIRFilters
* general purpose IIR filters

# DSPFilters
* general purpose DSPfilters

# SpuceFilters
* general purpose Filters

# CppFilters
* Generatel purpose biquad filters

# MultiMassberg
* General purpose multibands massberg

# ZolzerFilter
* Biquads from DAFX books

# RbjFilter
* The standard RBJ equations
