# AudioLAB
 Generic LV2 Plugins

# There are a tremenedous amount of them
* It is going to take a while to connect the LV2 frames to them all
* They will be highly detailed to do any theory possible

# AnalogSVF
* Will pirkins equations
* mono audio channel
* stereo audio channels
* midi input , cc103 = cutoff, cc104 = resonance
* midi output (for control)
* built in adsr
* built in lfo
* cv control ports for all parameters

# Moog Ladder Filter
* From Github repo
* mono audio
* stereo channel audio
* midi input (note,controls), cc103=cutoff, cc104=resonance
* midi output (to cc etc)
* built in adsr
* built in lfo to cutoff, q
* cv control ports for all parameters

# RBJFilter
* all equations of RBJ
* mono and stereo
* midi input can set the keyboard frequency, cc103=cutoff,cc104=q,cc105=bandwidth,cc106=slope
* midi output to control synthesizer
* cv ports for everybody

# AR
* Attack Release envelope
* Midi note on
* Midi output to control etc
* CV Envelope output
* Audio in * envelope

# ASR
* Attack Sustain Release envelope
* Same as AR but sustains

# ADSR
* Attack Decay Sustain Release Envelope
* audio input * envelope
* cv envelope output
* cv envelope modulation input
* logic trigger on/off
